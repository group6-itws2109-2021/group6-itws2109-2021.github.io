I do not have much experience on web developemnt outside of Introduction to Information Technology and Web Science, so this was an opportunity to brush up my HTML and CSS
that I learned so far, and to study more on the sturcture and formating of HTML and CSS syntax and the wide amount of tags. I was particularly stuck in page formatting. I tried referencing my resume that I built from last year, with additional formating and style tags.
