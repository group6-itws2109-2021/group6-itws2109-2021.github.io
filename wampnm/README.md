# Reflection
Outside of Intro to ITWS I have had no other web development experience, so I did not 
explore any HTML or CSS that was new to me.  Instead, I made sure to review the structure
and syntax used in both languages in sort of a crash course refresher.  It took a while to remember all of the rules, but as I got further into the Lab 
I found myself falling back into the rhythm of HTML and CSS.
Initially, I had a lot of illegal formatting done inside unordered lists, but when I 
used the HTML validator I realized I could not have certain tags inside the 
unordered list.  Unfortunately, I had already formatted quite a bit on my
stylesheet, so I wanted to find a way to correctly format the HTML without
disrupting the style too much.  My solution was to change all the things that 
were tagged <p> within the unordered list to be tagged with <li> but to add
a style tage that removed the bullet points so that they kept their style.

For references for the Personal Page layout, I was able to look at my old 
resume lab from Intro to ITWS to see its
structure and also to get my profile
picture.
